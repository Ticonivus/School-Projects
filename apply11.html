		<p>Building good credit is an absolute must when it comes to navigating through the world, especially now when things get more and more expensive. Having a good credit score can really help you get that house or even apartment that you really like so you can move closer to work or relocate to a nicer, safer neighborhood. Also when you are looking for a new car it can be useful to also have great credit, especially if your old car may have problems. One last thing it can do is get you a great job, when the job may require you to have good credit, such as a DOD or government job. Below is listed some of the ways you can build good credit.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Apply for a secured credit card</li>
			<li>Apply for a credit-builder loan.</li>
			<li>Become an Authorized user on someone else's credit card</li>
			<li>Check your credit report often, and dispute any false claims.</li>
